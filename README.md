# MoneyMasters

This is a collaborative project for weeks 8 & 9 at The Iron Yard in Charleston, SC. Our task is to demonstrate proficiency in (and of course, learn more about) the numerous tools and technologies we have learned by building an expense tracking/ budgeting web application.

Speaking of tools & technologies, here is a summary of the primary tools we used in this project:
* Ruby on Rails
* React.js (we also have HTML views in case JavaScript is turned off)
* Director for client side routing
* Sass
* Postgres

The concept behind our app is modeled after YNAB's "month ahead" budgeting strategy. Income earned through one month is saved until the next budget, then spent or set towards savings/investments. In other words, July's income is spent in August. This technique drastically reduces financial stress, and greatly simplifies the budgeting process. Also, cashflow issues virtually disappear with the month ahead budget.
